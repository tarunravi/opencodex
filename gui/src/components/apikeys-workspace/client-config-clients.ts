 * Brand mark per client. Only a real asset belongs here; a client with none
 * falls back to a monogram tile rather than borrowing another product's logo.
 * Separate from `provider-icons.ts` on purpose: export-client ids and provider
 * ids are unrelated namespaces that happen to share the string "opencode".
 *
 * Every entry is the product's OWN first-party asset, fetched and verified;
 * provenance per file is recorded in `gui/public/provider-icons/README.md`.
 *
 * `kimi` points at an asset already committed for the Moonshot provider, which
 * is the same brand as the Kimi Code client -- reusing it beats fetching a
 * second copy of one logo.
 *
 * `dsh` uses the DeepSeek Harness favicon rather than `deepseek-color.svg`: the
 * harness is first-party DeepSeek but it is a different product from the model
 * provider, and the provider logo would be a borrowed mark.
 *
 * Three clients are absent on purpose. `gajae` publishes only raster marks,
 * `hermes` upstream ships a text-glyph placeholder with no path data, and
 * `aside` has no first-party web asset at all. Each renders a monogram, which is
 * what this map's rule prescribes; the README records the reason for each.
