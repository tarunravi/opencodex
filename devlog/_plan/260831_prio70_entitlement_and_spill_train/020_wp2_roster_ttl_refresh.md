# 020 — wp2: refresh the expired roster at the shared entry point (#3023)

Stacks on wp1. Consumes `002`. One PABCD cycle.

Branch: `codex/3023-roster-ttl-refresh`, based on the wp1 head (stacked child).

## Why it stacks rather than lands independently

wp2 makes the management surfaces re-read the entitlement record. wp1 fixes *what*
that record contains. Landing wp2 alone would refresh a still-wrong answer: the
bug would appear fixed on a warm cache and persist on a cold one.

## Change 1 — a conditional ensure, not an unconditional resolve

New export in `src/codex/model-entitlements.ts`: an ensure/freshness operation that
enters the real resolver **only** for credential/version entries that are missing
or past their own deadline. It must treat as cached answers:

- a confirmed roster inside `MODEL_ROSTER_TTL_MS`;
- a confirmed-empty entry (after wp1, unconfirmed with the 15s TTL);
- an unconfirmed failure entry inside `MODEL_ROSTER_FAILURE_TTL_MS`.

It must reuse the existing per-account/version keys and in-flight deduplication
(`:223`, `:455`) so concurrent pollers collapse into one upstream fetch.

### Amendment after audit round 1 (`004`, blocker 2): the logged-out hole

"Refresh entries that are missing" **misses forever** when there is no credential.
`MAIN_CODEX_ACCOUNT_ID` is always a candidate (`:500-506`), but
`accountCredentialSnapshot` returns null without one, so the account is filtered
out before any cache entry is created (`:539-550`). Nothing is ever cached, so
every poll re-enters the full resolver — ~24 times/minute, which is precisely the
cost this cycle forbids.

So the ensure needs a **bounded negative memo**: "no usable credential for account
X as of T", with its own short TTL, checked before credential enumeration. Absence
of a credential is a cacheable answer, not a cache miss.

Regression: repeated logged-out ensures perform zero credential enumerations after
the first. This is the assertion that proves the steady state, and it is red
against a naive implementation.

### The memo needs an invalidation hook (audit round 2 — `005`)

Credential commits do not invalidate entitlement state today
(`src/codex/account-store.ts:131`, `src/codex/auth-api.ts:2015`,
`src/codex/model-entitlements.ts:630`). So a negative memo means a **fresh login
stays invisible until the memo expires** — the user logs in and the dashboard still
shows nothing.

Two requirements, both testable:

1. **Pin the TTL explicitly** and keep it short. It bounds how stale a successful
   login can look, so it is a UX number, not an implementation detail.
2. **Clear the memo on known credential writes.** The account-store and auth-api
   commit points above are the hooks. Regression: log in, then the very next ensure
   sees the credential without waiting out the TTL.

Without (2) this cycle fixes a missing-rows bug by introducing a different
missing-rows bug.

## Change 2 — await it from the shared entry point

`src/server/management/model-rows.ts:50`, `listManagementModelRows`: await the
ensure in parallel with `fetchAllModels`, before `nativeModelRows` — the shape
`/v1/models` already uses (`src/server/index.ts:1155`).

```ts
const [routed] = await Promise.all([fetchAllModels(config), ensureCodexEntitlementFreshness(config)]);
```

This repairs all three reported surfaces at once because they funnel here:
`/api/models` directly, `/api/client-config` via `loadExportModels`, and
`ocx export` by requesting `/api/models` over HTTP
(`src/cli/export-command.ts:169`).

**Failure must not throw.** A rejection here would degrade sidecar candidates
(`src/sidecar/candidates.ts:29`) and could turn client-config into a 503. The
ensure resolves with a bounded fail-closed result; the rows stay short, which is
the honest outcome, and Change 3 makes that visible.

## Cost bound (the constraint that shapes this)

The dashboard reaches this entry point ~24 times/minute (`/api/sidecar-settings`
every 5s, computing vision and web-search candidates independently), ~30 with the
Models page open. Polls pause on a hidden document.

So the ensure must be a **cache read** in the steady state: no credential
enumeration, no allocation of a resolver context, no network. Measured target:
with a fresh roster, repeated calls perform zero fetches and no credential
validation. That assertion is a test, not a hope.

## Change 3 — moved out of this cycle

> Removed after audit round 1 (`004`, blocker 4). The draft named no transport.

`/api/models` returns a bare **array** (`src/server/management/model-routes.ts:352-354`)
and both the GUI and `ocx export` depend on that shape
(`gui/src/pages/Models.tsx:402-417`, `src/cli/export-command.ts:169-185`). A
top-level field breaks them; a per-row field duplicates global state on every row.

The honest diagnostic therefore needs its own endpoint decision, which is a design
question, not a line of code. It is now **wp4** (`040`). wp2 is the refresh fix and
nothing else.

## Regressions (each driven red first)

- `tests/codex-model-entitlements.test.ts` — fresh repeated ensure -> zero
  refetches; at TTL+1 concurrent callers -> exactly one; failed refresh stays
  unconfirmed with no retry for 15s.
- `tests/native-model-toggle.test.ts` — expired confirmed roster, `/api/models`
  still lists sol/terra/luna. Red today.
- `tests/management-client-config-route.test.ts` — same fixture; OpenCode map holds
  the GPT-5.6 entries; entitlement fetch count is 1.
- `tests/cli-export-command.test.ts` — repoint its fake proxy at the real
  `/api/models` handler. Its stubbed rows currently bypass the defective boundary,
  so today's green is vacuous for this defect.

## Must not change

The expiry check (`:509`) — serving expired grants breaks fail-closed revocation.
`/v1/models` authorization or version behaviour. Per-account/version keys.
Synchronous `nativeModelRows` must stay synchronous.

## Open question to settle during P

Whether a stale management request waits out the 8s entitlement timeout or returns
immediately with short rows. Serving stale rows is inconsistent with the current
posture, so the default is to wait — but 8s on a dashboard poll is its own problem.

Note the shape of the risk: the wait only happens on the *first* poll after expiry,
because in-flight deduplication collapses the rest. Resolve before B and record the
decision here.
