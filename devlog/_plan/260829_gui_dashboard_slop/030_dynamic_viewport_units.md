# 030 — Dynamic viewport units in scroll surfaces (wp3)

## Defect

`gui/src/styles.css:2003`:

```css
.logs-table-wrap { max-height: calc(100vh - 260px); }
```

`vh` is the *large* viewport: it ignores mobile browser chrome, so the log table
is capped for a viewport taller than the one the user can see, pushing the last
rows under the browser UI. The rest of the shell already moved to `100dvh`
(styles.css:244, 247, 411, 412, 2198), so this line is an outlier, not a
convention.

`styles.css:755` and `1222` cap toast width with `calc(100vw - Npx)`. Per CSS
Values and Units 4, `100vw` includes the classic scrollbar gutter, so a
scrollbar-reserving platform can in principle render a cap wider than the visible
area.

A separate, *reproduced* toast defect turned up while measuring that one: the
cap on `.action-toast` never applied at all. Every toast also carries `.notice`,
and `.notice { max-width: var(--prose-measure) }` is declared later in the same
file at equal specificity, so source order won and the toast resolved to 70ch
(542px) instead of its design width.

## Change

- `.logs-table-wrap` → `max-height: calc(100dvh - 260px)`.
- Add `.action-toast.notice { max-width: min(480px, calc(100vw - 48px)) }` — two
  classes so it beats the later `.notice` rule. Both halves of the cap are
  restated: dropping the viewport term let the toast reach the screen edge at
  430px (measured `left = 0`, losing the 24px inset the right side keeps).
- `styles.css:2003` is the only static `vh` in a scroll surface; the `12vh`
  padding on the toast wrapper is decorative offset, not a size cap, and stays.

### Not changed: the `vw` → containing-block rewrite

The scrollbar-divergence rewrite was reverted before commit because it could not
be reproduced on this surface: the probe measured `innerWidth == clientWidth`
(gap 0), so `100vw` and the containing block agree here and the change would have
been an unmeasured edit to a live width cap. The units stay `vw`; the toast is
fixed by the specificity rule above, which *was* reproduced.

## Verification

Behavioural, not textual: the probe compares each scroll container's computed
`max-height` against `visualViewport.height` and counts any cap that exceeds it
(`staticVh`). The gate fails on a non-zero count, so the assertion survives a
selector rename. Measured at a mobile profile where the visual viewport is
smaller than the large viewport. The toast cap was verified by reading its
computed `max-width` and rendered rect at 1440 and 430.

## Acceptance

- `staticVh = 0` at every swept cell, including the 430-wide mobile profile.
- No `calc(100vh` remaining in a scroll-surface cap.
- Toast computed `max-width` is 480px at 1440 (not 542px) and keeps its 24px
  inset at 430px.
